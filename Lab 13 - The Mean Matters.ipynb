    "The British Royal Air Force wanted to know how many warplanes the Germans had (some number `N`, which is a *parameter*), and they needed to estimate that quantity knowing only a random sample of the planes' serial numbers (from 1 to `N`). We know that the German's warplanes are labeled consecutively from 1 to `N`, so `N` would be the total number of warplanes they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "We normally investigate the random variation among our estimates by simulating a sampling procedure from the population many times and computing estimates from each sample that we generate.  In real life, if the British Royal Air Force (RAF) had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling. However, they didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations that we normally do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating a sampling procedure many times was a useful exercise in *understanding random variation* for an estimate, but it's not as useful as a tool for practical data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's flip that sampling idea on its head to make it practical. **Given *just* a random sample of serial numbers, we'll estimate `N`, and then we'll use simulation to find out how accurate our estimate probably is, without ever looking at the whole population.**  This is an example of *statistical inference*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We (the RAF in World War II) want to know the number of warplanes fielded by the Germans.  That number is `N`.  The warplanes have serial numbers from 1 to `N`, so `N` is also equal to the largest serial number on any of the warplanes.\n",

However, if the population size is big enough, the difference between sampling with replacement and without replacement is negligible. Think about why that's the case! This is why when we define `new_observations`, we sample with replacement."

    "The histogram looks different because there are not enough simulations to ensure that we generate a nice spread or distribution of values. As a result, there will be isolated bars and the histogram will be skewed. As far as confidence intervals go, 10 resamples are not enough to give a full picture of the original data set (using mean-based estimation) so we can obtain misleading values depending on how representative the 10 turn out to be."

    "\n",
    "Your friend has recommended you a book, so you look for it on an online marketplace. You decide to look at reviews for the book just to be sure that it's worth buying. Let's say that on Amazon, the book only has 80% positive reviews. On GoodReads, it has 95% positive reviews. You decide to investigate a bit further by looking at the percentage of positive reviews for the book on 5 different websites that you know of, and you collect these positive review percentages in a table called `reviews.csv`."

    "Often times, when conducting statistical inference, you'll want your estimate of a population parameter to have a certain accuracy. It is common to measure accuracy of an estimate using the SD of the estimate--as the SD goes down, your estimate becomes less variable. As a result, the width of the confidence interval for your estimate decreases (think about why this is true). We know from the Central Limit Theorem that when we estimate a sample mean, the SD of the sample mean decreases as the sample size increases (again, think about why this is true).  \n",
