            "['The U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) is the US Government’s (USG) flagship global malaria initiative led by USAID and implemented together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Initiative is results-based, focused, and exhibits a high level of financial and programmatic accountability. In 2015, PMI launched the next six-year strategy, setting forth a new bold vision, and an ambitious goal with specific objectives. The PMI Strategy for 2015-2020 takes into account the progress over the past decade and the new challenges that have arisen, and reflects the U.S. Government’s commitment to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity working towards the long term vision of a world free of malaria. The Bureau for Global Health (GH) serves as the Agency’s primary source of intellectual capital, technical leadership, and donor coordination for the health sector. GH is vested with the responsibility for advancing field-relevant, state-of-the-art research and the transfer of new technologies and approaches to field programs and in technically and programmatically supporting USAID Mission health program implementation in the field. The Office of Infectious Disease (ID) is one of GH’s eight offices. The Malaria Division is one of four divisions of the ID Office. Leadership, management, and oversight of PMI are carried out from the Malaria Division under the leadership of the US Global Malaria Coordinator as are management of USAID’s malaria research investments (most notably vaccine, drug, and insecticide research programs) and USAID’s global partner engagement including WHO and RBM Partnership to End Malaria.  To succeed in eliminating malaria, countries and their partners need to deploy the right resources at the right place and at the right time. By getting better, more accurate insights from existing data and accelerating the data-to-action cycle, countries and their partners can better respond to changes in on-the-ground conditions. That is why, in 2018, PMI began a major transformation towards greater use of data to inform decisions on resource allocation. As part of this new effort, PMI launched a new quarterly reporting process to ensure operational decision-making is based on timely and granular malaria data. In addition, at the headquarters level, PMI is developing a web-based data platform (“PMI Data Lake”) with analytics tools that will facilitate the triangulation and use of relevant datasets, including visualizations of epidemiological, supply chain, entomological, demographic, programmatic, and financial data. In addition to the quarterly reporting data, the PMI Data Lake will house other supply chain data including PMI order and shipment data and procurement planning and monitoring report data. In 2019, PMI entered a data sharing agreement with The Global Fund (GF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) that included supply chain data. This agreement provides the foundation to bring our various supply chain data together to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our supply chain program. Key responsibilities include: providing guidance, monitoring, and technical support related to SC data needs to USAID at headquarters, and in the field with USAID Missions, PMI country teams, technical counterparts, implementing partners, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies. S/he will exercise independent judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines. The Data Scientist will receive day to day guidance from the Malaria Division Supply Chain Branch Chief. Job RequirementsThe Data Scientist is a key member of the Malaria Division’s SC Branch team. The Data Scientist will provide technical and programmatic expertise to PMI’s SC efforts to support PMI’s increased focus on enhancing data-driven decision-making internally and externally within focus countries. The Data Scientist will provide technical and programmatic guidance and support to strengthen and guide SC data collection, reporting and integration and implementation of data management platforms across PMI focus countries. The Data Scientist will support the work of PMI staff at USAID headquarters and in PMI countries. The Data Scientist will work in collaboration with global malaria stakeholders and technical partners, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies to provide technical leadership with a focus on SC data and integration of data systems, strategic information management and data visualization. S/he will exercise professional judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines.Technical AssistanceServe as a technical and programmatic resource for PMI’s supply chain team, particularly focused on data related topics.Organize, compile, query and analyze programmatic and technical data related to supply chain (e.g., inventory levels throughout the supply chain, consumption/demand, supply plans, orders and shipments, etc.) from disparate sources and in different formats to improve PMI’s ability to use data to drive supply chain-related decisions, and organize/analyze/present data for use in briefings, publications, and reports.Carry out quantitative analyses and triangulation of data from a variety of sources (e.g. financial, programmatic, epidemiological, entomological, supply chain, demographic) to unearth implementation obstacles and opportunities. Create data visualizations to better represent these analyses for a variety of stakeholders. Implement, document, and test relevant computer code (in R, Python, C++, SQL or other common programming language).Perform database analysis using SQL, R, Python or equivalent and create new dashboards available to the broader team and audiences.Perform data quality checks on existing datasets used in supply chain and statistical analyses and improve existing tools for automating data validation processes. Participate in discussions and communicate technical information to both subject matter expert and non-expert audiences about quantitative analyses in order to interpret, vet, improve, and finalize results, and to formulate sound conclusions.Participate in data analysis activities on behalf of PMI in our coordination with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other partners as required to improve coordination.Support project management staff to monitor and combine implementing partners’ data as well as provide technical support in advising the PMI Supply Chain team’s data strategy to align with the larger PMI data activities.Country SupportProvide technical and programmatic support to one or more PMI focus countries and participate as an integral member of one or more interagency country support teams.Provide guidance and support to Missions and PMI country teams on the development of annual country malaria operational plans and assist in monitoring and tracking overall progress of PMI plans and activities.Provide advice and technical assistance to Missions involved in malaria efforts, particularly the PMI-targeted countries in sub-Saharan Africa.Provide support to Missions by participating in country support teams, reviewing mission strategies and annual reports and helping them to meet needs for technical and programmatic support.Professional developmentParticipate in professional continuing education, skills training and professional meetings to enhance relevant technical skills and career development.Complete and execute an Individual Learning and Training Plan and Annual Work Plan.Master’s degree with 7 years’ relevant experience or Bachelor’s degree and 9 years’ experience or higher in applied quantitative discipline such as, but not limited to, statistics, economics, computer science, mathematics or data science from a recognized institution.
